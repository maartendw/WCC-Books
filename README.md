# This is a sample expressJS application

# Creating an expressJS application (in typescript)

This is a pre-prepared client/server application. The steps made to create this application were the following: 

```JS
  mkdir books
  cd books
  npm init
  npm install --save-dev typescript
  npm install --save-dev tslint
  npm install --save express 
```

Then you have to fill the configuration files to typescript compiler (`tsconfig.json`) and linter (`tslint.json`). Use the ones made available here.

The server application is under folder `src`. The main file is `index.ts`. The application is developed in typescript. 

The client application is under folder `public`. The main file is `index.html` and the application is developed in javascript. 

To use the pre-prepared code, just open the zip and run 

```
npm install 
````

The run the command 

```
npm run start
````

and open the browser in the location 

```
https://localhost:8080
```
